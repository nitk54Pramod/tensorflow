# tensorflow
Basic Machine Learning Programs using Tensorflow 2.0
tensorflow  = tensor+flow ===> tensor is a unit which perform calculation on data. flow====> means a computational graph which includes nodes and edges. nodes are the tensors and the edges works as data transfer pipeline from one tensor to another tensor. this computation graph is a acyclic and directed graph.
